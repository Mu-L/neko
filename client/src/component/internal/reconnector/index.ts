/*

Reconnector handles reconnection logic according to supplied config for an abstract class. It can reconnect anything that:
- can be connected to
- can send event once it is connected to
- can be disconnected from
- can send event once it is disconnected from
- can provide information at any moment if it is connected to or not

Reconnector creates one additional abstract layer for a user. User can open and close a connection. If the connection is open,
when connection will be disconnected, reconnector will attempt to connect to it again. Once connection is closed, no further
events will be emitted and connection will be disconnected.
- When using deferred connection in opening function, reconnector does not try to connect when opening a connection. This is
the initial state, when reconnector is not connected but no reconnect attempts are in progress, since there has not been
any disconnect even. It is up to user to call initial connect attempt.
- Events 'open' and 'close' will be fired exactly once, no matter how many times open() and close() funxtions were called.
- Events 'connecÅ§' and 'disconnect' can fire throughout open connection at any time.
